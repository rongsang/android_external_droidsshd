This is DroidSSHd.
A tool to install, configure and manage a Dropbear SSH daemon on Android devices: secure, remote access to your device via network.

This variant is for Android (AOSP) CyanogenMod devices and doesn't include dropbear daemon.

Requires several binary tools from dropbear repository : dropbear, dropbearkey, sftp-server, scp

Note : These tools are included in CM7 roms but not in CM9 by default.

To include this tool in your AOSP roms,
just edit the .repo/manifest.xml and add this project.
